# Fetch-file

Fetching a file with Golang.

My old rooted Kindle 3 keyboard is unable to connect to HTTPS URLs because
it does not support the newer TLS protocol ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So I needed a very simple program
that just downloads the file and writes it to the disk.

Of course, it has to be cross-compiled to my Kindle 3 Keyboard (armv6l)

## Run locally

```bash
go run . <url> <output file>
```

## Binary

I've included the binary file in the [`dist`](dist) directory,
so you don't have to build it on your own.

## Cross compile

I ran this on Mac OS with apple silicon.

**NOTE: I used some ancient version of golang and docker image**

```
docker run -it --platform "linux/amd64" --rm \
  -v (pwd):/go/src \
  -w /go/src \
  docker.elastic.co/beats-dev/golang-crossbuild:1.10.8-arm \
  --build-cmd "go build -ldflags=\"-s -w\"" \
  -p "linux/armv6"
```

I was trying to save some MB with linker flags to strip the debugging information.
You can remove `-ldflags=\"-s -w\"` from the command above if you wish.
